# HTML and CSS Projects
 This repository is for html and css projects during the Tech Academy Bootcamp

 This repository contains 4 main websites, all built with HTML/CSS skills learned in this course.
 1. A Movie Showtimes site.
 2. A site for a Beach Resort w/ Dogs (basically a hotel where there are random dogs running around).
 3. A site for purchasing a time slot to meet your favorite Phillies players.
 4. A professional portfolio site for myself, Greg Andersson, an aspiring game developer.
 
 All of these were built with standard HTML/CSS, with the exception of the Movie Showtimes site which also utilized Bootstrap 4.
 
 Additional pages were built and pushed to this repository in order to train the skills necessary to create those 4 main sites.
