        <article>CLEARWATER, Fla. -- Trea Turner grinned. He knows his spot in the Phillies lineup has become something of an obsession for fans.

            First? Second? Third?
            
            “I’m just a big learn-your-job guy,” Turner said Saturday morning at BayCare Ballpark. “I want to know what my job is. What do you expect of me? I think sometimes that’s hard moving around in the lineup. So, wherever I do hit, I’d like to stick there and just kind of learn who’s in front of me, who’s behind me and [learn] how pitchers are going to pitch the guy in front of me, the guy behind me. I think that helps everybody, not just me.”
            
            Turner signed an 11-year, $300 million contract with the Phillies in December, giving them more reason to believe they can not only repeat as National League champions, but win the World Series. He has been one of baseball’s best players for years. His arrival has everybody salivating about what he could do atop an already formidable lineup. Phillies manager Rob Thomson said Turner will start the season hitting first while Bryce Harper recovers from Tommy John surgery. Kyle Schwarber could hit leadoff when Harper returns in June or July. Turner could then drop to second, separating the left-handed hitters.
